                <p>Dear Company,</p>
                <p>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
                   everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
                   every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
                   The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident
                   religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and
                   forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
                   civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
                   every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer,
                   every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
                   every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and
                   sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote
                   of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

                <p>First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to
                   achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing
                   a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
                   No single space project in this period will be more
                   impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range
                   exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or
                   expensive to accomplish.</p>

                <p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of
                   the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so
                   that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters
                   of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by
                   the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely
                   distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent
                   their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another,
                   how fervent their hatreds.</p>

                <p>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this
                   decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but
                   because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and
                   measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge
                   is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
                   postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>

                <p>The surface is fine and powdery. I can kick it up loosely with my
                   toe. It does adhere in fine layers, like powdered charcoal, to the
                   sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an
                   inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of
                   my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles. There seems
                   to be no difficult in moving around, as we suspected.</p>

                <p>The view of the Earth from the Moon fascinated me-a small disk,
                   240,000 miles away. It was hard to think that that little thing
                   held so many problems, so many frustrations.
                   Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars,
                   pestilence don't show from that distance.</p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p>First M. Last</p>
